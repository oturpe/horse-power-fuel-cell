## TODO
* Increase maximum measured voltage value. E.g. by scaling instead of constraining received value to storage size.
* Enable measurement of lower current values. For example, change the fixed resistor into trimmer and terminals allowing multimeter calibration.
* Add lcd screen
* Add fuel cell power output stage here?
