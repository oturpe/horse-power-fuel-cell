* arduino is facing wrong direction. the usb interface should be by the side of the board
* holes for block terminals are too small
* block terminal individual holes are not marked
* block terminal names should appear by the side of pcb, for easier reading when connecting

* should there be a capacitor at 12 V input? Without it, from a battery, the microcontroller goes down when solution pump starts
