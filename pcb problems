* arduino is facing wrong direction. the usb interface should be by the side of the board
* holes for block terminals are too small
* block terminal individual holes are not marked
* block terminal names should appear by the side of pcb, for easier reading when connecting
* There is no protective diode between 12 V in and the rest of the circuit. The 12 V stuff tries to run on 5 V from computer. Perhaps this was the reason why one Arduino was already destroyed?  
* Contrast adjust of the display (RV1) has the pins set wrong.

* should there be a capacitor at 12 V input? Without it, from a battery, the microcontroller goes down when solution pump starts
